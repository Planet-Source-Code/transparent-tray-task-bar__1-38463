### Description

Makes the System Tray, Task Bar and Start Button transparent. When mouse is over them, it will make them NOT transparent. Simple eh? I take no credit for the .bas file in the project. I took it from another project that makes any for transparent. This code was inspired by another submission a few days ago that was suppose to do the same thing, but the coder neglected to unclude the .bas that contained the functions needed for the program to work. So I made my own and here it is. You may steal, copy, delete or do whatever you want with this code, I don't mind.. Learn from it and enjoy it is all I care.. Note: may not work for older Operating Systems.
